== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I run this on my normal business live website? =
Technically yes. However, it absolutely makes no sense! You should think twice if you really want to do that.

Maintainig your websites is a whole another task than presenting your business and/or portfolio on your website.
MainWP Dashboard should live in a dedicated, security and performance optimized single site install (regular WordPress way, non-Multisite!) and only be used for this one purpose. Then adding Toolbar Extras (base plugin) AND Toolbar Extras for MainWP (this Add-On plugin) makes the perfect sense and will bring you the best results and time savings.


= Why is Toolbar Extras plugin required? =
Toolbar Extras is the "base" or "main" plugin. It provides a lot of functionality under the hood, like the settings page, and lots of helper functions. This plugin here, "Toolbar Extras for MainWP" is just an Add-On for it, adding features on top. It extends the functionality, that means, adding more specific items to the Toolbar. In this case specifically for the MainWP Dashboard plugin.


= Why is MainWP Dashboard plugin required? =
While technically the MainWP Dashboard plugin is not "required", this Add-On here makes absolutely no sense without it.


= Will this Plugin slow down my site? =
Absolutely not. The plugin will only do its stuff for logged-in Administrator users. It does nothing for visitors of your site. Plugin loads its stuff only when needed and if supported theme/ plugin is active. Plugin was built to be as lightweight as possible.


= Does the Plugin work with Multisite? =
Yes, technically it works fine in Multisite, you could even activate it Network-wide if you want. **However, it makes absolutely no sense to setup a "MainWP Dashboard Site" as Multisite install!** Such a "Dashboard Site" is for managing dozens of other websites and therefore should be absolutely lightweight and only focused on this one purpose. I would only ever recommend to run the MainWP Dashboard on a regular single WordPress install, which is also fine-tuned for security and performance.


= More info on Translations? =

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/toolbar-extras-mainwp/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `toolbar-extras-mainwp-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Toolbar Extras for MainWP"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/toolbar-extras-mainwp)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
